# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our software seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the DotCtl Form application, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public issues or discussions. Instead, please report them via email to our security team at:

**kareem209907@gmail.com** (Repository owner contact for security reports)

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity
- Your contact information for follow-up
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (optional)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment of receipt within 48 hours
- Regular updates on our progress during investigation
- Public disclosure once the vulnerability is fixed
- Credit for responsible disclosure (if requested)

### Scope

This security policy applies to the main DotCtl Form repository and any associated official packages.

### Vulnerability Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, data loss, system compromise
- **High**: Privilege escalation, significant data disclosure
- **Medium**: DoS attacks, moderate data disclosure
- **Low**: Minor information disclosure, low-impact issues
- **Info**: Security improvements or best practices

### Supported Versions

Security updates will be provided for the latest version and supported major versions. Older versions may not receive security patches.

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:
1. Confirm the vulnerability exists
2. Work on a fix (with regular updates to the reporter)
3. Request credit information (optional)
4. Publish the fix and security advisory simultaneously

We will not delay disclosure to wait for fixed versions to be updated.

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted under this policy to be authorized, and will not pursue legal action against researchers who discover vulnerabilities and report them according to this policy.

Thank you for helping keep DotCtl Form and our users safe!
